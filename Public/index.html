            Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the
            National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It
            is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, ALGOL-68,
            SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.Now it is maintained by a core
            development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in
            directing its progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
            Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as
            other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other
            languages.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Easy-to-learn:</strong> Python has relatively few keywords, simple structure
              and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language in a
              relatively short period of time.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Easy-to-maintain:</strong> Python's success is that its source code is fairly
              easy-to-maintain.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>A broad standard library:</strong> One of Python's greatest strengths is the
              bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows
              and Macintosh
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Interactive Mode:</strong> Support for an interactive mode in which you can
              enter results from a terminal right to the language, allowing interactive testing and
              debugging of snippets of code.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Portable:</strong> Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and
              has the same interface on all platforms.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Databases:</strong> Python provides interfaces to all major commercial
              databases.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Expandable:</strong> You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter.
              These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more
              efficient.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>GUI Programming:</strong> Python supports GUI applications that can be created
              and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC,
              Macintosh and the X Window system of Unix.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scalable:</strong>Python provides a better structure and support for large
              programs than shell scripting.

            Let's write our first Python program, "Hello, World!". It's a simple program that prints
            Hello World! on the standard output device (screen).
          </p>
          <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
          <p>When you run the program, the output will be:</p>
          <pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
          <p>
            In this program, we have used the built-in print() function to print Hello, world!

        </header>
        <hr />
        <article>
          <p>A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. Here's an example:</p>
          <pre><code>a = 5</code></pre>
          <p>Here, a is a variable. We have assigned 5 to variable a</p>
          <p>We do not need to define variable type in Python. You can do something like this:</p>
          <pre><code>a = 5
print("a =", 5)
a = "High five"
print("a =", a)</code></pre>
          <p>
            Initially, integer value 5 is assigned to the variable a. Then, the string High five is
            assigned to the same variable. By the way, 5 is a numeric literal and "High five" is a
            string literal. When you run the program, the output will be:
          </p>
          <pre><code>a = 5
a = High five</code></pre>

            Operators are special symbols that carry out operations on operands (variables and
            values).Let's talk about arithmetic and assignment operators in this part.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition,
            subtraction, multiplication etc.
          </p>
          <pre><code>x = 14
y = 4

# Add two operands
print('x + y =', x+y) # Output: x + y = 18

# Subtract right operand from the left
print('x - y =', x-y) # Output: x - y = 10

# Multiply two operands
print('x * y =', x*y) # Output: x * y = 56

# Divide left operand by the right one 
print('x / y =', x/y) # Output: x / y = 3.5

# Floor division (quotient)
print('x // y =', x//y) # Output: x // y = 3

# Remainder of the division of left operand by the right
print('x % y =', x%y) # Output: x % y = 2

# Left operand raised to the power of right (x^y)
print('x ** y =', x**y) # Output: x ** y = 38416</code></pre>
          <p>
            Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. You have already seen the
            use of = operator. Let's try some more assignment operators.
          </p>
          <pre><code>x = 5
# x += 5 ----> x = x + 5
x +=5
print(x) # Output: 10

# x /= 5 ----> x = x / 5
x /= 5
print(x) # Output: 2.0</code></pre>
          <p>Other commonly used assignment operators: -=, *=, %=, //= and **=.</p>

        <h3>Single line comment</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters
            after the # and up to the physical line end are part of the comment and the Python
            interpreter ignores them.
          </p>
          <pre><code># Here you should write comments
print 'Hello, Python'   
#This line is skipped by interpreter because it is after hash sign

        </article>
        <h3>Multi line comment</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            “““ or ''' are used to write multi line comments if they are not inside a string
            literal.
          </p>
          <pre><code>'''
This is a multi line
comment
'''

        <h3>if...else Statement</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            The if...else statement is used if you want perform different action (run different
            code) on different condition. For example:
          </p>
          <pre><code>num = -1

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")

# Output: Negative number</code></pre>
          <p>
            There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.Most programming
            languages use {} to specify the block of code. Python uses indentation.A code block
            starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of
            indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.
          </p>
        </article>
        <h3>while Loop</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Like most programming languages, while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as
            long as the test expression (condition) is true. Here is an example to find the sum of
            natural numbers:
          </p>
          <pre><code>n = 100

# initialize sum and counter
sum = 0
i = 1

while i < n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1    # update counter

print("The sum is", sum)

# Output: The sum is 5050</code></pre>
        </article>
        <h3>for loop</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other
            iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.Here's an example to
            find the sum of all numbers stored in a list.
          </p>
          <pre><code>numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
sum = 0

# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
  sum = sum+val

print("The sum is", sum) # Output: The sum is 28</code></pre>

          <p>
            Notice the use of in operator in the above example. The in operator returns True if
            value/variable is found in the sequence. In Python, for loop can have optional else
            block. The else part is executed if the items in the sequence used in for loop exhausts.
            However, if the loop is terminated with break statement, Python interpreter ignores the
            else block.

      <section id="Python Function" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h2>Python Function</h2>
        </header>
        <hr />
        <article>
          <p>
            A function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task. You use def
            keyword to create functions in Python.
          </p>
          <pre><code>def print_lines():
  print("I am line1.")
  print("I am line2.")</code></pre>
          <p>You have to call the function to run the codes inside it. Here's how:</p>
          <pre><code>print_lines()</code></pre>
          <p>A function can accept arguments.</p>
          <pre><code>def add_numbers(a, b):
  sum = a + b
  print(sum)

add_numbers(4, 5)

# Output: 9</code></pre>
          <p>
            In Python, you can define functions without a name. These functions are called lambda or
            anonymous function. To create a lambda function, lambda keyword is used.
          </p>
          <pre><code>square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(5))

# Output: 25</code></pre>
          <p>
            We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.
            Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like filter(), map() etc.
